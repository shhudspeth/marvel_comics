# Marvel Comics Analysis

Here lies a program that takes Marvel Comics data and creates data structures that compile elements for analysis. 

marvel_comics.py find a random marvel comics characters and presents some facts on that character. There is room to make this interactive or a simple Api that gets character information. Another idea is to make generate a storyline from the information. 

get_data.py loads the data from a csv file. 


In the notebooks folder there are two jupyter notebooks that do more in depth analysis on the dataset. One is focused on queer characters. The other is prep-work for some machine learning on whether or not a given marvel character will have blue eyes, based on some features. 

In the images folder, there are any graphs and plots generated from the data. Most of that code is reproducible and primed to adapted for other uses.
